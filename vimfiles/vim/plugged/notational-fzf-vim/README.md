## Description

Vim is great for writing. But it isn't optimized for note-taking, where
you often create lots of little notes and frequently change larger notes
in a separate directory form the one you're working in. For years I used
[nvALT](http://brettterpstra.com/projects/nvalt/) and whenever I had to
do serious editing, I would open the file in Vim.

But some things about nvALT bugged me.

-   It's not meant for large text files, and opening them will cause it
    to lag *a lot*.

-   I can't use splits

-   I do most of my work in Vim, so why have another window open,
    wasting precious screen space with its inferior editing
    capabilities. Sorry Brett, but nvALT can't match Vim's editing
    speed.

-   I also disagree with some parts of Notational Velocity's philosophy.

Plugins like [vim-pad](https://github.com/fmoralesc/vim-pad) didn't do
it for me either, because:

-   I don't want to archive my notes. I should be able to just search
    for them.
-   I don't want to use the first line as the title since I have notes
    with duplicated titles in different directories, like `README.md`.
-   I just want to be able to search a set of directories and create
    notes in one of them, ***quickly***.

When [Junegunn](https://github.com/junegunn/) created
[`fzf`](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf), I realized that I could have
all that, in Vim.

This plugin allows you to define a list of directories that you want to
search. The first directory in the list is used as the main directory,
unless you set `g:nv_main_directory`. If you press `control-x` after
typing some words, it will use those words as the filename to create a
file in the main directory. It will then open that file in a vertical
split. If that file already exists, don't worry, it won't overwrite it.
This plugin never modifies your files at any point. It can only read,
open, and create them.

You can define relative links, so adding `./docs` and `./notes` will
work. Keep in mind that it's relative to your current working directory
(as Vim interprets it).

This plugin may not work on Windows. I only have a Mac to test it on. It
works for sure on Mac with Neovim, and *should* work in terminal Vim,
since it's just a wrapper over `fzf`.

## Installation

``` {.vim}
" with vim-plug
Plug 'https://github.com/Alok/notational-fzf-vim'
```

## Changes

Read `CHANGELOG.md`.

## Dependencies

`ag` is required for its fast search. I'm not planning on changing this
anytime soon.

-   [`fzf`](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf).

-   `fzf` Vim plugin. Install the Vim plugin that comes with `fzf`,
    which can be done like so if you use
    [vim-plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug).

    ``` {.vim}
    `Plug 'junegunn/fzf', { 'dir': '~/.fzf', 'do': './install --all' }`
    ```

-   [`ag`](https://github.com/ggreer/the_silver_searcher)

## Optional Dependencies

-   [`coderay`](https://github.com/rubychan/coderay), for the ability to
    preview files, with syntax highlighting.
-   [`highlight`](http://www.andre-simon.de/doku/highlight/en/highlight.html).
    Will be used instead of `coderay` if available.

## Required settings

You have to define a list of directories (which must be strings) to
search.

``` {.vim}
" example
let g:nv_directories = ['~/wiki', '~/writing', '~/code']
```

## Usage

This plugin unites searching and file creation. Type `:NV` or bind it to
a mapping to bring up a fuzzy search menu. Type in your search terms and
it will fuzzy search for them.

It does not search in a fully fuzzy fashion because that's less useful
for prose. It looks for full words, but they don't have to be next to
each other. You can use the arrow keys or `c-p` and `c-n` to scroll up
and down the search results, and then hit one of these keys to open up a
file:

-   `c-x`: Use search string as filename and open in vertical split
-   `c-v`: Open in vertical split
-   `c-s`: Open in horizontal split
-   `c-t`: Open in new tab
-   `<Enter>`: Open highlighted search result in current buffer

The first few lines of the selected file will be visible in a preview
window.

## Mappings

This plugin defines a command `:NV`, and if you want a mapping for it,
then you can define it yourself. This is intentionally not done by
default. You should use whatever mapping or mappings work best for you.

For example,

``` {.vim}
nnoremap <c-s> :NV<CR>
```

## Optional settings and their defaults

If you want shortened pathnames, you ***must*** copy the Python script
in this repo somewhere into your `$PATH`.

It *must* be named `shorten_path_for_notational_fzf.py` and have
executable permissions.

You can toggle the preview window by pressing `alt-p`.

``` {.vim}
" String. Set to '' (the empty string) if you don't want an extension appended by default.
" Don't forget the dot, unless you don't want one.
let g:nv_default_extension = '.md'

" String. Default is first in directory list.
let g:nv_main_directory = g:nv_directories[0]

" Boolean. Show preview. Set by default. Pressing Alt-p in FZF will toggle this for the current search.
let g:nv_show_preview = 1

" Boolean. Wrap text in preview window.
let g:nv_wrap_preview_text = 1

" Integer. Width of preview window. 72 characters by default.
let g:nv_preview_width = 72

" String. Determines where the preview window is. Valid options are: 'right', 'left', 'up', 'down'.
let g:nv_preview_direction = 'right'

" Boolean. If set, will truncate each path element to a single character. If
you have colons in your pathname, this will fail. Not set by default.
let g:nv_use_short_pathnames = 0

"List of Strings. Shell glob patterns. Ignore all filenames that match any of
the patterns.
let g:nv_ignore_pattern = ['summarize-*', 'misc*']
```

You can also define your own handler function, in case you don't like
how this plugin handles input but like how it wraps everything else. It
*must* be called `NV_note_handler`.

## Potential Use Cases

-   Add `~/notes` and `~/wiki` so your notes are only one key binding
    away.
-   Add relative links like `./notes`, `./doc`, etc. to
    `g:nv_directories` so you can always see/update the documentation of
    your current project and keep up-to-date personal notes.

## FAQ

Q: I get an error updating with `vim-plug`.

A: Remove the plugin with `:PlugClean` and re-run `:PlugInstall`.

## Philosophy

To quote [scrod](https://github.com/scrod/nv/issues/22),

> The reasoning behind Notational Velocity's present lack of
> multi-database support is that storing notes in separate databases
> would 1) Require the same kinds of decisions that
> category/folder-based organizers force upon their users (e.g., "Is
> this note going to be work-specific or home-specific?"), and 2) Defeat
> the point of instantaneous searching by requiring, ultimately, the
> user to repeat each search for every database in use.

-   By providing a default directory, we offer (one) fix to the first
    issue.

-   By searching the whole set of directories simultaneously, we handle
    the second.

It also handles Notational Velocity's issue with multiple databases.
UNIX does not allow repeated filenames in the same folder, but often the
parent folder provides context, like in `workout/TODO.md` and
`coding/TODO.md`.

This plug-in attempts to abstract the operation of note-taking over
*all* the notes you take, with priority given to one main notes
directory.

## Caveat Emptor

-   There is no Simplenote syncing, and there never will be. I use plain
    text files synced over services like Dropbox for my notes, and I
    don't plan on changing that anytime soon.

-   This plugin is just a wrapper over FZF that can view directories and
    open/create files. That's all it's ever meant to be. Anything else
    would be put into a separate plugin.

## Feedback

Is ***always*** welcome. If you have any ideas or issues, let me know
and I'll try to address them. Not all will be implemented, but if they
fit into the philosophy of this plugin or seem really useful, I'll do my
best.
